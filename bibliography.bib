In this study, we explore the influence of workplace dignity on employee work behaviors that affect organizational performance. Framing our inquiry with Sharon Bolton’s yetuntested multidimensional theory of dignity, we analyze Randy Hodson’s content-coded ethnographic data to reveal that increases in workplace dignity tend to predict increases in employee engagement, yet have mixed effects on counterproductive workplace behaviors. Following a post-hoc ethnographic reimmersion, we identify the critical role of safe and secure working conditions in enabling and constraining employees’ ability to redress or resist workplace indignities with counterproductive workplace behaviors.},

We examine the ways in which LGBTQ employees experience dignity threats in the workplace and the protection strategies they use to deﬂect those threats. Interviews with 36 LGBTQ working adults revealed that their dignity is threatened by a range of identitysensitive inequalities that undermine their safety and security when they claim authentic gendered/sexual identities. Speciﬁc safety and security threats to dignity include social harm, autonomy violations, career harm, and physical harm. To (re)claim their dignity, they engage in four primary dignity protection strategies: avoiding harm by seeking safe spaces, deﬂecting harm with sexual identity management, offsetting identity devaluations by emphasizing instrumental value, and creating safe spaces for authenticity and dignity.

Drawing from a variety of sources including interviews, social media, and news coverage, we studied how Dalit (formerly known as ‘untouchable’) janitors were treated during the performance of janitorial labor for cleaning the city. Our study focuses on two theoretical premises: (a) caste-based social relations reproduce inequalities by devaluing Dalit labor as ‘dirty work’; and (b) Dalit subjectivities, labor, and sufferings including occupational hazards become invisible and ungrievable forcing Dalits to provide a counter narrative to preserve the memory of their trauma and dignity injuries. We find that the discursive construction of janitorial labor as dirty work forced Dalit janitors to work in appalling and unsafe working conditions. Janitors suffered several dignity injuries in terms of social exclusion and a lack of recognition for their efforts and accomplishments. Specifically, we examine various ways through which caste, dirty work, and dignity intersected in the narrative accounts of Dalit janitors. We also explore memory and how processes of remembering and forgetting affected the dignity claims of Dalit janitors.},

However, research to date has either focused on the conditions that contribute to workplace dignity or how individuals experience and respond both to dignity and dignity threats. Little is known about the psychological and behavioral consequences of dignity in the workplace. Building on the resource caravans principle of conservation of resources (COR) theory, this study attempts to bridge this gap and investigates ‘how’ employees’ perceptions of workplace dignity might affect their discretionary work effort. Two-wave survey data were collected from 180 employees in the development sector organizations in Pakistan and the bootstrap mediation analysis using PROCESS macro was performed to test the hypothesis. Whilst workplace dignity, organization-based self-esteem, and discretionary work effort were found to be positively associated with each other, organization-based self-esteem mediated the workplace dignity–discretionary work effort relationship. More specifically, workplace dignity positively predicted discretionary work effort through increasing organization-based self-esteem. As a pioneering study examining how workplace dignity affects discretionary work effort, this research not only advances the relevant literature, but also lends credence to COR theory’s relatively less scrutinized resource caravans principle. Implications for theory, research, management practice, and strategic human resource management are also discussed.},

While the communicative constitution of resilience in situations of job loss has received significant attention, we know little about how resilience is constituted in the face of ongoing job insecurity. This study explores that question by considering how a group of employees enacted resilience during the 22-month period between the announcement that their worksite would close and the actual closure. Based on in-depth interviews, this study considers how soon-to-be terminated employees created and maintained resilience by (de)centering themselves, framing the future optimistically, affirming their value, keeping work in perspective, and caring for one another. These findings point to the importance of sensemaking that enabled employees to hold conflicting emotions and interpretations in tension and meaningfully enact purpose, agency, and humanity. Specifically, the analysis suggests that maintaining dialectics and cultivating dignity are important for constituting resilience. This study contributes to our understanding of the communicative constitution of resilience by offering a sixth central process—maintaining dialectics—to the communication theory of resilience and suggesting that workplace interactions that cultivate dignity enable resilience.},

I argue that the problem of human rights was central to Arendt's political theory. While she does not elaborate a theory of human rights as such, and while she avoids the juridical approaches so common among human rights theorists and advocates, her conception of political action is intended to secure an elemental human dignity that is systematically jeopardized by the imperatives of national sovereignty.},

While normally the type of legal system (monist or dualist) creates differences in the application of international law, in the Indian context, judicial activism has on many occasions bridged this difference. The paper studies how international law has served both the traditional statist protectionist position and the modern substantive equality approach. Further, in a domestic setting, the Supreme Court has made women an apparent subject of international law. From direct incorporation of international law to making adequate use of its persuasive value, the Supreme Court has used different methodologies in its reasoning and decisions. Without using any specific approach in enforcing international law in India, the court has cherry picked the catalogue of international instruments to place itself in the larger international legal community. All these judgments have been justified within the constitutional limits and therefore, it forges a positive and legitimate relationship between international and domestic law.},

By alternating case study and reflection, it argues that a systemic and biocentric focus on human- nature relationships, extending the concepts of capabilities and functionings to ecosystems and human- nature interactions, is important for designing adequate tools for human-nature development, monitoring and for moving beyond ascribing merely instrumental value to nature. In order to shift the common understanding of human rights and human development from anthropocentric frameworks toward a more realistic biocentric focus, a focus on life as such is proposed, including inherent moments of arising and passing that express the necessary limitations to all human conduct and striving.},

She proposes that human dignity can serve as the basis of an entitlement to a set of capabilities that all human beings either possess or have the potential to develop. This article considers whether the concept of human dignity will serve as the justiﬁcation for basic human capabilities in accounting for the demands of justice for people with profound learning difﬁculties and disabilities. It examines the relationship between dignity and capabilities, suggesting that Nussbaum fails to distinguish between several conceptions of human dignity, whilst also identifying one of these conceptions as coming close to meeting several of her demands. It is difﬁcult enough, however, to show how dignity is related to just one of our basic entitlements, and even that requires more than the resources available in Nussbaum’s approach.},

In this article, I explore some significant ways in which racially restrictive covenants differed from dignity takings as Atuahene defines them, as well as the shadowy similarities between racial covenants and Atuahene's dignity takings; I focus here on the dimensions of dehumanization, state involvement, and property takings. I conclude with a discussion of remedies, particularly considering measures that restore dignity through both public policies and private actions.},

Arguing against this sympathetic position on the other side of the debate are the sceptics, who have raised troubling questions about dignity's alleged indeterminacy, as well as about the illiberal role that it has allegedly played in certain contexts. In this article, I argue that designing a defensible and useful conception of dignity which is distinguishable from other values such as equality and autonomy may be possible, but not without addressing some genuine infirmities that the critics have pointed out. If there is indeed such a defensible conception of dignity, it is likely to be 'expressive' in character. I therefore argue that the legal ideal of dignity is best understood as an expressive norm: whether an act disrespects someone's dignity depends on the meaning that such act expresses, rather than its consequences or any other attribute of that act.},

Particularly, we focus on the implications of shame in the delivery of antipoverty measures, as an individual and social phenomenon that relates to feelings of self-inadequacy, as well to a lack of dignity and recognition. We analyze delivery interactions through an analytic framework of rights, discretion and negotiation, as this enables us to parse out how policy delivery interactions presumed or enabled individual choice, ability, control, and voice. We suggest social citizenship can structure the relationships between welfare recipients and administrators. As a concept, it expands the objects of social rights beyond the materiality of human life (e.g., housing, pensions) to include intangible processual elements (e.g., dignity) in the construct of rights.},

	abstract = {In the current Spanish conjuncture, characterized by political and economic crisis and the rapid impoverishment of the working classes, we have seen the emergence of moral discourses around indignation and the demand of dignity. While these moral exhortations have rightly been scrutinized with skepticism from Marxist positions for their lack of attention to political economic structures, this paper discusses whether we can find in them elements for what Gavin Smith calls a "re vindicative politics," able to transcend the frame of reference of the society of capital. Exploring the notion of dignity both in the Indignados movement and in my own ethnographic field site of Southern Catalonia - a region where claims to dignity have saturated the sphere of the political for decades - I suggest that the demand for dignity should be understood as an expression of what Ernst Bloch called "nonsynchronous contradictions," being not entirely reducible to the contemporary workings of capitalist accumulation. Dignity points toward unsettled memories and unfulfilled pasts as well as to a rejection of servile relations and the desire to make sense of oneself outside of the morality of capital. Understanding this demand for dignity forces Marxist anthropologists to look at capital from the "margins," challenging its centrality. In so doing it also invites us to refine and invigorate our critique of political economy.},

In Heyman's and Waldron's accounts we find plausible insights into the nature of identity-based social hierarchies, and the harms that redound to subordinated people under the operations of such hierarchies. 1 argue, however, that both analyses are unsuc cessful as justifications for the restriction of hate speech, because they do not ultimately provide reason to think that hate speech is responsible for creating or sustaining identity-based social hierarchies.},

Two themes emerge, the first related to an imagined institutional trajectory of progress attached to labor activation in which participants were offered “more” and the second to whether participants and caseworkers had a meaningful voice in co-negotiating the terms of activation. Unrealistic optimism and an institutional focus placed on individual participants’ new responsibilities fueled a longerterm negative impact. Descriptions of enhanced rights, new possibilities for negotiation, and reported feelings of shame and frustration depended both on the participant’s distance to the labor market and on the point at which respondents were interviewed.},

The essay provides a richer account of Kant's contribution to the "politics of equal dignity" by examining his understanding of dignity and honour, and the interaction between these concepts. The essay argues that Kant appeals to multiple varieties of dignity and honour, that he does not reject honour in favour of dignity, and that he sees some versions of honour as conducive to respect for dignity. Furthermore, the complexity of Kant's views on dignity and honour has implications for the theory and practice of human rights in the current day.},

Even so, the human dignity concept is in unhelpful disarray. Dignity is variously viewed as an antecedent, a consequence, a value, a principle, and an experience, from philosophical, legal, pragmatic, psychological, behavioral, and cultural perspectives. We ask which if any of these human dignity concepts will likely serve our global common interests best, as both common ground and policy diagnostic? We examine four broad themes: dignity as (1) a metaphysical justification for human rights and duties, (2) virtuous comportment or behavior, (3) a perspective of "other," and (4) a subjective experience of the individual, contingent on a broad and equitable sharing of values. We recommend viewing dignity as a commonwealth of individually assessed well-being, shaped by relationships with others, affected by the physical world, and framed in terms of values. Viewed this way, the idea of dignity accommodates the priorities of both individualistic and communitarian cultures. Conceiving of human dignity as a commonwealth of subjectively experienced value production and enjoyment has many practical policy implications.},

	abstract = {Real problems, like the problem posed, are not amenable to simple solutions. Human rights abuses in internal conflicts usually have roots deep in history and the collective psyche of the individuals and groups involved. To prevent them, the certain prospect of a swift punitive reaction on the international plane might have a useful deterrent effect. But if a violent conflict or genocide is in progress, the expectation of punishment may not by itself be likely to end the conflict. Ironically, it may prolong the plight of the persecuted, since persecutors may conclude that they have no alternative but to fight to the bitter end to avoid the consequences of their misdeeds. To deal with major incidents of unauthorized coercion and violence, an amnesty for the violators might contribute to a lessening of the toll in blood of a particular ethnic or religious rage. But that, again, might be an incomplete reaction, since the victims of the atrocities committed will not find solace, satisfaction or rehabilitation. Nor will persons who may be pathologically violent be removed from circulation. Where society remains unreconciled, jarred, conflicted—in a state of continual animosity between warring families, clans or ethnic, religious or social groups—“cold” war might heat up and erupt at any time in the future even more violently than before. Thus, truth commissions have been established in various contexts at least to shine the light of searching inquiry on situations in which truth has always been the first casualty. Still, such agencies alone might not suffice to bring about social reconciliation and restoration. Neither might bodies set up to mete out justice in the form of civil compensation. International criminal courts may send a message to people elsewhere contemplating massive violations, but they may do nothing to reconstruct the civil society that has been disrupted.},

It influences not only the overall approach to, and accepted purpose of, punishment, but also the types of sanctions that are typically doled out, the setup of their prisons, and the conditions in which prisoners find themselves once in custody. Although human dignity is not the paramount value in the American criminal justice system, this article contends that recent criminal justice reform efforts implicate human dignity into system practices to a greater degree than ever before. While the reform efforts are prompted by a concern for efficiency and efficacy, policymakers are increasingly relying on research that indicates that more humane and individualized treatment of offenders is a key component to achieving desired public safety outcomes. The article starts with a brief discussion of how human dignity became a central value of the European system and contrasts this with the historically weaker sway human dignity has played in the American system. It then demonstrates that the principle of human dignity is gaining influence through recent legislative reform efforts in the United States as well as changes in correctional training and supervision practices.},

Along with liberty and equality, it is a necessary condition for collective self-governance. Dignity enables robust exercise of liberty and equality while resisting both neglectful libertarianism and paternalistic egalitarianism. The civic dignity required for democracy is specified through a taxonomy of incompletely and fully moralized forms of dignity. Distinctive features of different regimes of dignity are modeled by simple games and illustrated by historical case studies. Unlike traditional meritocracy and universal human dignity, a civic dignity regime is theoretically stable in a population of self-interested social agents. It is real-world stable because citizens are predictably well motivated to defend those threatened with indignity and because they have resources for effective collective action against threats to dignity. Meritocracy and civic dignity are not inherently liberal, but may persist within a liberal democracy committed to universal human dignity.},

            Human dignity as a value to guide criminal justice reform emerged strikingly in the 2011 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Plata. But with Justice Kennedy retired and courts generally reluctant to go far down the road to practical reforms, its future lies in the political realm shaping policy at the local, state, and national levels. For human dignity to be effective politically and in forming policy, we need a vocabulary robust enough to convey a positive vision for the penal state. In this essay, I discuss three concepts that can provide more precision to the potential abstractness of human dignity, two of which the Supreme Court has regularly used in decisions regarding punishment: the idea of a “decent society,” the idea of a “civilized system of justice,” and the idea of a “condition of dignity.” In brief, without a much broader commitment to restoring a decent society, and to civilizing our justice and security systems, there is little hope that our police stations, courts, jails, and prisons will provide a condition of dignity to those unfortunate enough to end up in them.},

I argued that the appropriate remedy for a dignity taking is “dignity restoration”: material compensation to dispossessed populations through processes that affirm their humanity and reinforce their agency. For this symposium, contributors were invited to examine these paired concepts through case studies beyond the South African context. This introductory essay summarizes the central arguments of

Prison terms are incomparably longer. The greater frequency of imprisonment is a product of punitive attitudes and politicization of crime control policies. The longer terms result partly from abolition of parole release in every jurisdiction for all or some inmates, but mostly from the proliferation since the mid-1980s of mandatory minimum, three-strikes, life without parole, and truth-in-sentencing laws. The ideas that offenders should be treated as equals and with concern and respect for their interests largely disappeared, though they had been animating values of earlier indeterminate and determinate sentencing systems. Their disregard is evident in the nature of contemporary laws but also in low-visibility policies and practices including the near absence of meaningful systems of appellate sentence review, low standards of proof at sentencing, and the absence of standards for sentencing of people convicted of multiple offenses at one time or over time.},

In this article, I explore some significant ways in which racially restrictive covenants differed from dignity takings as Atuahene defines them, as well as the shadowy similarities between racial covenants and Atuahene's dignity takings; I focus here on the dimensions of dehumanization, state involvement, and property takings. I conclude with a discussion of remedies, particularly considering measures that restore dignity through both public policies and private actions.},

The notion of incorporating dignity into CBA, this highlights the importance of choosing between different conceptions of CBA derive a monetary figure for dignity, and one that seeks to take dignity unmonetized form. This Note illuminates the stakes of the choice between monetized and unmonetized CBA by drawing attention to various ways in which dignity might be incorporated into CBA. The Note then argues that CBA can and must include dignity in unmonetized form. In doing so, agencies should embrace "qualitative specificity," which involves elucidating in qualitative terms the nature and gravity of dignitary considerations in a particular regulatory context. Qualitative specificity, the Note indicates, enables agencies more transparendy to assess the positive and negative consequences of government regulation, and it facilitates public participation in the process of defining the nature of dignity in the senses relevant to the effects of government regulation. In response to the critique that qualitative specificity is indeterminate and fails to constrain administrative discretion, the Note contends that qualitative specificity provides only as much determinacy as is actually available; this approach is preferable to monetization that emerges with a determinate number but fails to accommodate the complex and malleable nature of dignity.},

	abstract = {Each operating in a presumptively general or universal register, “public goods” and “human rights” are among the most popular and visible contemporary carriers of ideas of global law and governance and are therefore prime sources for any broader project of global justice. Their combination, moreover, holds out the prospect of a fertile engagement between the two core concerns of modern political morality—our collective requirements and potential (public goods) and our individual dignity and well-being (human rights). Yet for all their ambition, public goods and human rights each face the formidable challenge of placing considerations of political authority and political morality in productive balance. Exploring both, we face the frustrating phenomenon of one hand clapping—a failure to reconcile authority and morality in a satisfactory manner. The discourse of global public goods presupposes rather than provides grounds for the relevant “public” and so suffers from a general deficit of political authority. In turn, this reinforces the incompleteness of its claim in political morality. The discourse of human rights, perhaps surprisingly, reveals stronger authoritative roots; however, these are locally situated, and the soil becomes very thin as we move away from the state to the broader global environment and the familiar yet ethically abstracted moral discourse of universal entitlement. In conclusion, I argue, it is precisely because both of these dimensions of global ethics—public goods and human rights—face the same type of difficulty of the grounding political authority that their conjunction in a single scheme does not allow either to compensate for the deficiencies of the other.},

Thereafter follows a review of the literature on value creation stakeholder management and convergent stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984; Freeman, Harrison, Wicks, Palmer, \& DeColle, 2010; Harrison \& Wicks, 2013; Jones \& Wicks, 1999), as the foundation for our concept of stakeholder capability enhancement. The remainder of this article develops a model that integrates stake holder management with the human capability approach to detail the cooperative advantage that accrues to business and its stakeholders, as well as the gains in social wellbeing and dignity, when stakeholder capability enhancement becomes a common enterprise strategy. The model also explores the risks and boundary conditions firms face when seeking to profit from stakeholder capability tradeoffs. In explaining the model, we explore normative responsibilities and consequences with regard to human capabilities and dignity. We conclude with implications for future research.},

We analyze delivery interactions through an analytic framework of rights, discretion and negotiation, as this enables us to parse out how policy delivery interactions presumed or enabled individual choice, ability, control, and voice. We suggest social citizenship can structure the relationships between welfare recipients and administrators. As a concept, it expands the objects of social rights beyond the materiality of human life (e.g., housing, pensions) to include intangible processual elements (e.g., dignity) in the construct of rights.},

In the process, great weight is given to Alan GewirtiYs "dialectically necessary argument" for human dignity, grounding the concept in human agency. The second part explores some of the apparent major implications: a rejection of both positive methodology and cultural relativism; the questioning of eco? nomic rationality and the efficiency norm; much of commercial advertis? ing; and cost-benefit analysis. It also serves as a critique of the Kaldor-Hicks criterion, the institution of the wage system and of an unqualified application of cost-benefit analysis.},

	abstract = {Thiruvalluvar is proud to know and clearly express the ability of the guaranteed objects of virtue, meaning, pleasure and home required for human society. It is a great honor for him that Thiruvalluvar became famous for singing the flute during his lifetime. He is credited with compiling a wonderful book, Thirukkural, which summarizes the facts he has seen and experienced in his life. The human rights mentioned in Thirukkural are an example of Thiruvalluvar's vision. Human beings discriminate between the superior and the inferior and deprive the lower castes of their rights. This leads to many tribulations. Such victims come together and claim their rights. Thirukkural, which appeared in a period of ups and downs, condemns such differences and insists that all people are equal by birth. The king says that if the people are enslaved and persecuted, his wealth will be destroyed by the tears of the people. Therefore, it is clear that the king must provide the necessary facilities for the people. Human rights law makes it clear that if a person is charged, he should be considered innocent until proven guilty. Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Anyone who asks for something should explore its true meaning without accepting it as it is. The eye is important to every living thing in the world. Likewise, it is important to get an eye-like education. Everyone should get the best rich education that will never be destroyed. Seeing the war for hunger, Valluvar snarls at those who subjected them to cruelty. The literature that arose for human development is Thirukkural. Thirukkural acts as a medicine wherever and however a human being is injured. If the world listens to the human rights voice of Ayyan Valluvar, there will be no war and no conflict on this soil.},

Despite their importance, we have little systematic information on the correlates of public trust in LHROs. To fill this gap, we conducted key informant interviews with 233 human rights workers from sixty countries, and then administered a new Human Rights Perceptions Poll to represen tative public samples in Mexico (n = 2,400), Morocco (n = 1,100), India (n = 1,680), and Colombia (n = 1,699). Our data reveal that popular trust in local rights groups is consistently associated with greater respondent familiarity with the rights discourse, actors, and organizations, along with greater skepticism toward state institutions and agents. The evidence fails to provide consistent, strong support for other commonly held expectations, however, including those about the effects of foreign funding, socioeconomic status, and transnational connections.},

Buchanan identifies two functions of the ILHRS: a well-being function and a status egalitarian function. Because Buchanan assumes that the well-being function is sufficientarian, he augments it with a status egalitarian function. However, if the well-being function is utilitarian or prioritarian, there is no need for a separate status egali tarian function, because the status egalitarian function can be subsumed by th utilitarian or prioritarian well-being function.},

The article shows that despite shared objectives and a common commitmen rights, NGO and government discourses differ sharply and yield markedly different a egies.

	abstract = {The Scheduled Castes/“Dalits” represent the “untouchables” in India’s constitutional framework and are traditionally outside the four-tiered rung of the Hindu religion. The notion of “superiority, pollution and separateness” is ingrained in the stratification of caste and the victim complex is subsumed in the unwritten public code. Despite the safeguards in the constitution and affirmative legislation they still suffer from institutional discrimination and structural violence inherent in the caste system. It takes the form of hierarchy which is an intrinsic part of the Hindu faith and the Dalits are employed in occupations such as human scavenging. The prevalence of caste discrimination in the rural areas of India makes for any affirmative legislation to be ineffective for the majority of the population. The issue has been magnified in recent times by the ascension of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) into power which has retrenched Hindutva, with the consequence that Dalits who convert from Hinduism to Islam or Christianity have to forfeit access to welfare benefits. This paper analyses the cause of the institutional discrimination that criminalizes the Dalit communities and the lack of impact of the legal protections afforded to them. It will argue that the victimization of the “untouchables” will continue because of the rigid caste structure, lack of enforcement of legal protection in villages, economic privilege and the resort to ideology of the current government.},

She thinks that this is the case for three different reasons: the first has to do with the fact that the dominant concept of dignity is based on religious beliefs which will do no justificatory work in a secular society; the second is that the dominant secular view of dignity, which is the Kantian view, does not provide us with a justification of human rights, i.e. rights all humans have; and the third reason has to do with the fact that dignity is understood in too many different ways to provide us with a justification of human rights. It is argued in this paper that none of these reasons for separating human rights from human dignity is convincing. It is true, it will be argued, that some accounts of dignity will not be successful in justifying human rights. But there is no reason to assume that no account of human dignity is capable of doing this. In the final part of the paper a concept of human dignity is presented that could indeed provide us with a justificatory basis for human rights.},

	abstract = {Why should all human beings have certain rights simply by virtue of being human? One justification is an appeal to religious authority. However, in increasingly secular societies this approach has its limits. An alternative answer is that human rights are justified through human dignity. This paper argues that human rights and human dignity are better separated for three reasons. First, the justification paradox: the concept of human dignity does not solve the justification problem for human rights but rather aggravates it in secular societies. Second, the Kantian cul-de-sac: if human rights were based on Kant's concept of dignity rather than theist grounds, such rights would lose their universal validity. Third, hazard by association: human dignity is nowadays more controversial than the concept of human rights, especially given unresolved tensions between aspirational dignity and inviolable dignity. In conclusion, proponents of universal human rights will fare better with alternative frameworks to justify human rights rather than relying on the concept of dignity.},

According to most h rights doctrines, including most notably the Universal Declaration of H Rights (UDHR), human rights aim to protect "human dignity."

Accordin Glenn Hughes (2011), human rights theorists ought to consider hum dignity as an "intrinsically heuristic concept," whose content is par understood but is not fully determined. In this comment, I criticize Hu account. On my view, understanding inherent human dignity as an sically heuristic concept tethers it to an "indeterminateness of sense," w leaves it open to exploitation from theorists unsympathetic to the salience of rights and what rights are supposed to protect.},

	abstract = {Human dignity is making a comeback. The essay focuses on the story that this comeback of human dignity presupposes and recasts. In that story, the “human family” is portrayed in terms of aristocratic dignitas. The consequences are twofold: (1) human dignity is co-implicated with the deanimalization of the human being; (2) once de-animalization is introduced, the story of human dignity cultivates an aristocratic sense of elevation of the human over other species, or what I will call “species aristocratism.” The fact that a new kind of aristocratism based on species emerges from the story of human dignity should concern us, I suggest, because it not only confronts us with unintended consequences of relying on human dignity as the foundation of human rights but also invites us to rethink our contemporary egalitarian, democratic ethos, understood as aristocracy for all.},

The traditional approach has commonly focused on the ethical aspects of human subject research and little has been said about the implications of human experimentation on the enjoyment of basic rights. The difference between ethical principles and human rights is clearly determined by the non-enforceability of ethical norms and the legally binding nature of human rights obligations. A human rights approach to bioethics, and particularly to human subject research, can bring about a defined system and universally accepted set of rules in a field where sociocultural and religious diversity come into play.},

The latter discussion identifies three subcategories of business ethics research involving human dignity: the role of dignity as a cornerstone for paradig matic shifts, the role of dignity as the 'ultima ratio' for the protection of human rights, and the role of dignity in organizing business practices.

In this paper, I argue that Wolterstorff's theory concerning human dignity falls prey to something quite similar to the classic Euthyp either God must love every existing human in a dignity-bestowing man not, and either option is problematic. If the former, then whatever it is that ensures God's love can reasonably be thought to be the independ human dignity and/or rights, thereby leaving us without cause to appea for the explanation of this dignity. If the latter, the implication is that m which appear to be necessarily true are only contingently so. Wolterstorff thus require substantial modification, or else abandonment.},
